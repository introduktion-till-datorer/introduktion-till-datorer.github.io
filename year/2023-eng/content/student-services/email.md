Click on the settings cog at the to right to configure email forwarding.

## Email etiquette 

When writing an email to a teacher or other university staff, there are a few
things to keep in mind.

### Subject

Many employees receive hundreds of messages a week. A relevant subject helps the
recipient prioritize and search among different messages.

If the matter concerns a particular course, include the
course code already in the subcet. An example of a subject 
may look like this:


``` text
1TG298 autumn 2020 - The Student services assignment
```

### Give context

Begin the message by clearly explaining who you are. If your message is about a
specific course, clearly identify the course and when you took the course. 
A continuation of our example could look like this.


``` text
My name is Anna Anderson and I studied the course 1TG298 in autumn 2020.
```

### Keep it short and to the point

Next, keep the message short and to the point with the most
important first. In our example, the message could continue like this.


``` text
I have now re-submitted the Student Services assignent. Although I'm very late,
I hope someone has time to grade my sumbisson. 

Sincerely,

Anna Andersson
```
