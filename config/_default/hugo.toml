    # Relearn Theme
    # These options are specific to the Relearn theme.

    # Filename suffix for variant files.
    # Default: not set
    # The theme modifies the variant stylesheets during build and tries to store
    # them with the same file name. In certain installations it was observed, that
    # Hugo could not overwrite these files due to permission issues. If you
    # experience this, you can first try to set the `--noChmod` option for Hugo.
    # If this still doesn't help you can set this option to eg. ".gen". This will
    # be used as a suffix for these generated files, causing them to be newly
    # created instead of overwriting the existing ones.
    themeVariantModifier = ".gen"


    #++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    # Variants
    # These options set your color variant.

    # Used color variants.
    # Default: "auto"
    # This sets one or more color variants, available to your readers to choose
    # from. You can either set a single value eg. "zen-light" or an array like
    # [ "neon", "learn" ]. If the array has more than one entry, a variant selector
    # is shown in the lower part of the menu. The first entry in the array is the
    # default variant, used for first time visitors.
    # The theme ships with the following variants: "auto", "relearn-bright",
    # "relearn-light", "relearn-dark", "zen-light", "zen-dark", "neon", "learn",
    # "blue", "green", "red". The auto variant is somewhat special. See the
    # option for themeVariantAuto below.
    # You can also define your own variants. See the docs how this works. Also,
    # the docs provide an interactive theme generator to help you with this task.

    themeVariant = ["dark", "light"]

    # The color variants used for auto mode.
    # Default: [ "relearn-light", "relearn-dark" ], overwritten by the first
    # two non-auto options of your `themeVariant` option if present.
    # The auto variant defines how your site adjusts to your selected OS settings
    # for light/dark mode. The first array element is the variant for light mode,
    # the second for dark mode.
    # themeVariantAuto = ["dark", "light"]

    # Default: false
    # If shown, a Home button will appear below the search bar and the main menu.
    # It links to your the home page of the current language.
    disableLandingPageButton = true

    # Hide copy-to-clipboard for inline code.
    # Default: false
    # This removes the copy-to-clipboard button from your inline code.
    disableInlineCopyToClipBoard = true

    # The initial expand state of submenus.
    # Default: not set
    # This controls whether submenus will be expanded (true), or collapsed (false)
    # in the menu. If not set, the first menu level is set to false, all others
    # levels are set to true. This can be overridden in the page's frontmatter.
    # If the displayed page has submenus, they will always been displayed expanded
    # regardless of this option.
    alwaysopen = false

    # Shows expander for submenus.
    # Default: false
    # If set to true, a submenu in the sidebar will be displayed in a collapsible
    # tree view and a clickable expander is set in front of the entry.
    collapsibleMenu = true

    # Shows checkmarks for visited pages of the main menu.
    # Default: false
    # This also causes the display of the `Clear History` entry in the lower part
    # of the menu to remove all checkmarks. The checkmarks will also been removed
    # if you regenerate your site as the ids are not stable.
    showVisitedLinks = true

    # Generate link URLs the Hugo way.
    # Default: false
    # If set to true, the theme behaves like a standard Hugo installation and
    # appends no index.html to prettyURLs. As a trade off, your build project will
    # not be servable from the file system.
    disableExplicitIndexURLs = true

    ##### TWEAKS BY KARL

    # Tweak by Karl. Don't show chapter numbers for the the chapter archetype. 
    # Default: false
    # If set to true, the chapther number will not be rendered for the chapter 
    # archetype. 
    # This new logic has been added in my
    # layouts/partials/archetypes/chapter/article.html theme relearn override. 
    disableShowChapterNumber = true

    #++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    # Images
    # These options configure how images are displayed.

    # What to do when local image link is not resolved.
    # Default: ""
    # You can control what should happen if a local image can not be resolved to as
    # a resource. If not set, the unresolved link is written as given into the resulting
    # output. If set to `warning` the same happens and an additional warning is
    # printed. If set to `error` an error message is printed and the build is
    # aborted.
    # Please note that this can not resolve files inside of your `static` directory.
    # image.errorlevel = "error"

    # Image effects.
    # See the documentation for how you can even add your own arbitrary effects to
    # the list.
    # All effects can be overridden in the page's frontmatter or through URL parameter
    # given to the image. See the documentation for details.
